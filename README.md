# Smart-Salary-Vision
Smart SalaryVision, developed during the Eudnet AI/ML 6-week training, is an interactive ML platform that predicts salaries based on age, education, gender, experience, and job title. It selects the best model (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest) and supports both dashboard and bulk (CSV) predictions with clear analytics.
