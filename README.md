# Smart-Salary-Vision
Smart SalaryVision is a machine learning project developed during the Eudnet AI/ML 6-week training to create an accurate and interactive salary prediction platform. It addresses the challenge of estimating employee compensation fairly and efficiently by leveraging features such as age, education, gender, experience, and job title. The system utilizes several machine learning models, including Random Forest and XGBoost, selecting the best based on performance metrics like RÂ² score. It supports both single-entry predictions through an interactive dashboard and bulk predictions via CSV upload, offering intuitive visualizations to enhance user understanding. This project demonstrates end-to-end data science skills from data cleaning to deployment, delivering a scalable, user-friendly solution for HR analytics and career planning.
